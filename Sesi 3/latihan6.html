        Our comprehensive guide to CSS flexbox layout. This complete guide
        explains everything about flexbox, focusing on all the different
        possible properties for the parent element (the flex container) and the
        child elements (the flex items).This defines the ability for a flex item
        to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a
        proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the
        flex container the item should take up. If all items have flex-grow set
        to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally
        to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, that child
        would take up twice as much of the space either one of the others (or it
        will try, at least).
